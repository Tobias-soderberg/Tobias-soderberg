            I’m Tobias — an analytical and reliable developer who enjoys solving
            real problems and building software that people want to use. I’m
            especially interested in backend and full-stack development, where I
            can design dependable systems and turn complex ideas into practical
            solutions.

            After my internship at Efacec, I’m now looking for my first
            full-time developer role where I can keep learning, contribute to a
            strong team, and create technology that makes everyday life a little
            better.
